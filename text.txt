settings/install atom-live-server from packages and keybindings to start server by ctrl+alt+3
install webpack devserver by this changes in html directly render in browser.
add js and link with html it works too.

for js to require another js make bundle.js by> webpack script-1.js ./bundle.js .
module.exports in one js and in script-1.js var msg = require(./script-2)
---------------------1 to run webpack by package.json  so do npm run start----
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaWKUpahFZM in this at 2.22 it says in package.json scripts { "start": "webpack ./src/script-1.js ./dist/bundle.js" }
-------------------------
--------2 to run by  webpack.config.js-  do  > webpack in command line
with webpack.config file we dont need to write " webpack script-1.js ./bundle.js" to run
only script command is enough
 -delete bundle.js and folder and bundle created auto dist/bundle.js when run webpack
 -and made src folder for js

const path = require('path');
module.exports = {
  entry: './src/script-1.js',
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    filename: 'my-first-webpack.bundle.js'
  }
};

<script src="./dist/bundle.js"></script>


--------------babel loaders
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_QACBSqRBE&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iTQ3J5oa6orDIMQKKxl8dC&index=4  Webpack Tutorial for Beginners #4 - Babel Loaders
webpack loaders perform tranformations on our code
babel-loaders can be used to transform ES6 or ES2015 code (and JSX) into vanilla JavaScript.

how to tranform --install babel-core babel-loader and install any presets to perform transformations(eg for es2015 tranform install es22015preset and for jsx its preset) and
configure webpack.config to use babel
eg es2015 have const msg ="hi" ; module.exports = msg; //we have to use babel in webpack to transform to var in bundle.js

module: {
   loaders: [
       {
           test: /\.js$/,  ////js file test only js not others like html readme etc extensions regular expression
           exclude: /(node_modules)/, //this not to test with loader
           loader: 'babel-loader',
           query: {
               presets: ['es2015']
           }
       }

   ] //loaders
} //module

now we can use const of es2015
