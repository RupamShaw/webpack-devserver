settings/install atom-live-server from packages and keybindings to start server by ctrl+alt+3
install webpack devserver by this changes in html directly render in browser.
add js and link with html it works too.

for js to require another js make bundle.js by> webpack script-1.js ./bundle.js .
module.exports in one js and in script-1.js var msg = require(./script-2)
-------- webpackconfig
with webpack.config file we dont need to write " webpack script-1.js ./bundle.js" to run
only script command is enough
 -delete bundle.js and folder and bundle created auto dist/bundle.js when run webpack
 -and made src folder for js

const path = require('path');
module.exports = {
  entry: './path/to/my/entry/file.js',
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    filename: 'my-first-webpack.bundle.js'
  }
};

<script src="./dist/bundle.js"></script>
